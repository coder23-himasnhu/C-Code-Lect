Graph:- It is a nonlinear DS consisting of vertices(node) and edges.
Graph has two types:- Directed and Undirecred graph
Directed graph:- The nodes connected with its has direction
UnDirected graph:- The nodes connected with its doesnt has a direction.
Cyclic graph:- The graph has a cycle.
Acyclic graph:- The graph doesnt has a cycle.
Connected graph:- Normal undirected graph is also called connected graph but the directed graph can also be connected graph if it is cyclic(so, 
we travel anywhere in graph).
Disconnected graph:- If the nodes are not connected with each other.
Complete graph:- The graph is called the complete graph if each nodes are connected with all nodes.
To find the edges of the complete node, the formula is nC2.
