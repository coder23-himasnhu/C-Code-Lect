// hoe to store two number in one address
// Ans:- let we have 1 to 99 number and we have to store that number in between this,
// eg:- 222222 the number is 2 and its occurance is 6 so 26 is store in that location

// another eg:- take 1 biggest of 99 i.e 100 then 2+6*100 is store in that location, after uploding that number in array if we want to know the number 
// and its occurance then 
// number:-602%100=2 so 2 is that number
// occurance:-602/100=6 so the occuranc of 2 is 6 time

// another eg:- 12 12 12 12 so 12+4*100is store in the location
// number:- 412%100=12;
// occurance:- 412/100=4;
